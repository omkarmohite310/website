# Biography

Greetings!!

My name is Omkar, and I am curious about unraveling complexities in biological systems using computational and mathematical tools. I am interested to integrate, analyse and understand large biological systems and data in order to make predictions towards better healthcare. 

I have received B.Tech. and M.Tech. in Biological Engineering from IIT Madras in July 2017. As part of my master's thesis, I have worked with Dr. Karthik Raman towards understanding redundancies in genome scale metabolic networks through analysis of synthetic lethals. I have gained the skills in mathematical modelling, metabolic network analysis, bioinformatics, bio-process, metabolic engineering through my research and educational experience. I wish to pursue a research career in the fields of mathematical and systems biology. 

I am currently working as a Junior Research Fellow as part of a DBT Project titled "A computational pipeline for Identifying the Context of Key Mutations in Cancer Genomes".

I love travelling, trekking and listening to rock music. I am an amateur weightlifter and follow the sport passionately.
